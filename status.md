Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've finished the Chi-Squared Table

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have yet to finish the Punnet Square automation.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

It is really difficult to figure out how to create all possible combinations from lists of lists. I've organized my alleles in lists, which are all stored in a bigger list by gene. 

Note. I changed my project to this after splitting with Omar Shakir. I gained approval from Dr. Rosen.
