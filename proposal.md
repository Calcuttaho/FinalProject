# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Genetic Tedium Automated

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A couple of functions which automatically do some of the most tedious parts of genetics, with tables that have proper notation.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

There are three parts to the project. The first is to automatically generate a punnett square of any size from parents with any genes. The second is to automatically write a Chi-Squared table for analysis, with a P-value being returned as well as a X^2 value. The third is to calculate recombination frequencies of two genes on the same chromosome.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Complete all the Chi-Squared Table.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Complete all three tasks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Complete all three tasks with proper notation, and returning tables which look good and efficiently provide information needed. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps are to complete a step by step lineup of what needs to be done. Doing these tasks by hand is not difficult, just time consuming. Programming it to work with any number of phenotypes, or any number of genes becomes more difficult. Punnett Squares in particular have a lot of rules that are easy to follow when doing the work by hand, such as putting dominant alleles before recessive alleles, and following a hierarchy of dominance for alleles, but figuring out how to program that becomes more difficult. Similarly, chi-Squared values are simply a series of calculations. 

I also need to figure out how to make tables and do statistical equations, especially so for calculating a P-value.
